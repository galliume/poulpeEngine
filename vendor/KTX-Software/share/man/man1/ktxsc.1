.SH NAME
ktxsc \- Supercompress the images in a KTX2 file\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
ktxsc [options] [\fIinfile\fP \&.\&.\&.]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBktxsc\fP can encode and supercompress the images in Khronos texture format version 2 files (KTX2)\&. Uncompressed files, i\&.e those whose vkFormat name does not end in \fC_BLOCK\fP can be encoded to ASTC, Basis Universal (encoded to ETC1S then supercompressed with an integrated LZ step) or UASTC and optionally supercompressed with Zstandard (zstd)\&. Any image format, except Basis Universal, can be supercompressed with zstd\&. For best results with UASTC, the data should be conditioned for zstd by using the \fI--uastc_rdo_q\fP and, optionally, \fI--uastc_rdo_d\fP options\&.
.PP
\fBktxsc\fP reads each named \fIinfile\fP and compresses it in place\&. When \fIinfile\fP is not specified, a single file will be read from \fIstdin\fP and the output written to \fIstdout\fP\&. When one or more files is specified each will be compressed in place\&.
.PP
The following options are available: 
.IP "\fB-o outfile, --output=outfile \fP" 1c
Write the output to \fIoutfile\fP\&. If \fIoutfile\fP is 'stdout', output will be written to stdout\&. Parent directories will be created, if necessary\&. If there is more than 1 \fIinfile\fP the command prints its usage message and exits\&. 
.IP "\fB-f, --force \fP" 1c
If the destination file cannot be opened, remove it and create a new file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its permissions\&. 
.IP "\fB--t2 \fP" 1c
Output a KTX version2 file\&. Always true\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB--encode <astc | etc1s | uastc> \fP" 1c
Compress the image data to ASTC, transcodable ETC1S / BasisLZ or high-quality transcodable UASTC format\&. Implies \fB--t2\fP\&. With each encoding option the following encoder specific options become valid, otherwise they are ignored\&. 
.IP "\fBastc: \fP" 1c
Create a texture in high-quality ASTC format\&. 
.IP "\fB--astc_blk_d <XxY | XxYxZ> \fP" 1c
Specify which block dimension to use for compressing the textures\&. e\&.g\&. \fB--astc_blk_d\fP 6x5 for 2D or \fB--astc_blk_d\fP 6x6x6 for 3D\&. 6x6 is the default for 2D\&. Supported 2D block dimensions are: 4x4 8\&.00 bpp 5x4 6\&.40 bpp 5x5 5\&.12 bpp 6x5 4\&.27 bpp 6x6 3\&.56 bpp 8x5 3\&.20 bpp 8x6 2\&.67 bpp 10x5 2\&.56 bpp 10x6 2\&.13 bpp 8x8 2\&.00 bpp 10x8 1\&.60 bpp 10x10 1\&.28 bpp 12x10 1\&.07 bpp 12x12 0\&.89 bpp Supported 3D block dimensions are: 3x3x3 4\&.74 bpp 4x3x3 3\&.56 bpp 4x4x3 2\&.67 bpp 4x4x4 2\&.00 bpp 5x4x4 1\&.60 bpp 5x5x4 1\&.28 bpp 5x5x5 1\&.02 bpp 6x5x5 0\&.85 bpp 6x6x5 0\&.71 bpp 6x6x6 0\&.59 bpp 
.IP "\fB--astc_mode <ldr | hdr> \fP" 1c
Specify which encoding mode to use\&. LDR is the default unless the input image is 16-bit in which case the default is HDR\&. 
.IP "\fB--astc_quality <level> \fP" 1c
The quality level configures the quality-performance tradeoff for the compressor; more complete searches of the search space improve image quality at the expense of compression time\&. Default is 'medium'\&. The quality level can be set between fastest (0) and exhaustive (100) via the following fixed quality presets: Level  Quality  fastest  (equivalent to quality = 0)  fast  (equivalent to quality = 10)  medium  (equivalent to quality = 60)  thorough  (equivalent to quality = 98)  exhaustive  (equivalent to quality = 100)  
.IP "\fB--astc_perceptual \fP" 1c
The codec should optimize for perceptual error, instead of direct RMS error\&. This aims to improve perceived image quality, but typically lowers the measured PSNR score\&. Perceptual methods are currently only available for normal maps and RGB color data\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fBetc1s: \fP" 1c
Supercompress the image data with ETC1S / BasisLZ\&. RED images will become RGB with RED in each component\&. RG images will have R in the RGB part and G in the alpha part of the compressed texture\&. When set, the following BasisLZ-related options become valid, otherwise they are ignored\&. 
.IP "\fB--no_multithreading \fP" 1c
Disable multithreading\&. Deprecated\&. For backward compatibility\&. Use \fB--threads\fP 1 instead\&. 
.IP "\fB--clevel <level> \fP" 1c
ETC1S / BasisLZ compression level, an encoding speed vs\&. quality tradeoff\&. Range is [0,5], default is 1\&. Higher values are slower but give higher quality\&. 
.IP "\fB--qlevel <level> \fP" 1c
ETC1S / BasisLZ quality level\&. Range is [1,255]\&. Lower gives better compression/lower quality/faster\&. Higher gives less compression/higher quality/slower\&. \fB--qlevel\fP automatically determines values for \fB--max_endpoints\fP, \fB--max-selectors\fP, \fB--endpoint_rdo_threshold\fP and \fB--selector_rdo_threshold\fP for the target quality level\&. Setting these options overrides the values determined by -qlevel which defaults to 128 if neither it nor both of \fB--max_endpoints\fP and \fB--max_selectors\fP have been set\&.
.PP
Note that both of \fB--max_endpoints\fP and \fB--max_selectors\fP must be set for them to have any effect\&. If all three options are set, a warning will be issued that \fB--qlevel\fP will be ignored\&.
.PP
Note also that \fB--qlevel\fP will only determine values for \fB--endpoint_rdo_threshold\fP and \fB--selector_rdo_threshold\fP when its value exceeds 128, otherwise their defaults will be used\&. 
.IP "\fB--max_endpoints <arg> \fP" 1c
Manually set the maximum number of color endpoint clusters\&. Range is [1,16128]\&. Default is 0, unset\&. 
.IP "\fB--endpoint_rdo_threshold <arg> \fP" 1c
Set endpoint RDO quality threshold\&. The default is 1\&.25\&. Lower is higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1\&.0,3\&.0])\&. This will override the value chosen by \fB--qlevel\fP\&. 
.IP "\fB--max_selectors <arg> \fP" 1c
Manually set the maximum number of color selector clusters from [1,16128]\&. Default is 0, unset\&. 
.IP "\fB--selector_rdo_threshold <arg> \fP" 1c
Set selector RDO quality threshold\&. The default is 1\&.25\&. Lower is higher quality but less quality per output bit (try [1\&.0,3\&.0])\&. This will override the value chosen by \fB--qlevel\fP\&. 
.IP "\fB--no_endpoint_rdo \fP" 1c
Disable endpoint rate distortion optimizations\&. Slightly faster, less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit\&. Default is to do endpoint RDO\&. 
.IP "\fB--no_selector_rdo \fP" 1c
Disable selector rate distortion optimizations\&. Slightly faster, less noisy output, but lower quality per output bit\&. Default is to do selector RDO\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fBuastc: \fP" 1c
Create a texture in high-quality transcodable UASTC format\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_quality <level> \fP" 1c
This optional parameter selects a speed vs quality tradeoff as shown in the following table:
.PP
Level Speed Quality 0 Fastest 43\&.45dB 1 Faster 46\&.49dB 2 Default 47\&.47dB 3 Slower 48\&.01dB 4 Very slow 48\&.24dB 
.PP
You are strongly encouraged to also specify \fB--zcmp\fP to losslessly compress the UASTC data\&. This and any LZ-style compression can be made more effective by conditioning the UASTC texture data using the Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) post-process stage\&. When uastc encoding is set the following options become available for controlling RDO: 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_l [<lambda>] \fP" 1c
Enable UASTC RDO post-processing and optionally set UASTC RDO quality scalar (lambda) to \fIlambda\fP\&. Lower values yield higher quality/larger LZ compressed files, higher values yield lower quality/smaller LZ compressed files\&. A good range to try is [\&.25,10]\&. For normal maps a good range is [\&.25,\&.75]\&. The full range is [\&.001,10\&.0]\&. Default is 1\&.0\&.
.PP
Note that previous versions used the \fB--uastc_rdo_q\fP option which was removed because the RDO algorithm changed\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_d <dictsize> \fP" 1c
Set UASTC RDO dictionary size in bytes\&. Default is 4096\&. Lower values=faster, but give less compression\&. Range is [64,65536]\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_b <scale> \fP" 1c
Set UASTC RDO max smooth block error scale\&. Range is [1\&.0,300\&.0]\&. Default is 10\&.0, 1\&.0 is disabled\&. Larger values suppress more artifacts (and allocate more bits) on smooth blocks\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_s <deviation> \fP" 1c
Set UASTC RDO max smooth block standard deviation\&. Range is [\&.01,65536\&.0]\&. Default is 18\&.0\&. Larger values expand the range of blocks considered smooth\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_f \fP" 1c
Do not favor simpler UASTC modes in RDO mode\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc_rdo_m \fP" 1c
Disable RDO multithreading (slightly higher compression, deterministic)\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB--input_swizzle <swizzle> \fP" 1c
Swizzle the input components according to \fIswizzle\fP which is an alhpanumeric sequence matching the regular expression \fC^\fP[rgba01]{4}$\&. 
.IP "\fB--normal_mode \fP" 1c
Only valid for linear textures with two or more components\&. If the input texture has three or four linear components it is assumed to be a three component linear normal map storing unit length normals as (R=X, G=Y, B=Z)\&. A fourth component will be ignored\&. The map will be converted to a two component X+Y normal map stored as (RGB=X, A=Y) prior to encoding\&. If unsure that your normals are unit length, use \fB--normalize\fP\&. If the input has 2 linear components it is assumed to be an X+Y map of unit normals\&.
.PP
The Z component can be recovered programmatically in shader code by using the equations: 
.PP
.nf

      nml\&.xy = texture(\&.\&.\&.)\&.ga;              // Load in [0,1]
      nml\&.xy = nml\&.xy * 2\&.0 - 1\&.0;           // Unpack to [-1,1]
      nml\&.z = sqrt(1 - dot(nml\&.xy, nml\&.xy)); // Compute Z
                 
.fi
.PP
 For ASTC encoding, '\fB--encode\fP astc', encoder parameters are tuned for better quality on normal maps\&. For ETC1S encoding, \fB'--encode\fP etc1s', RDO is disabled (no selector RDO, no endpoint RDO) to provide better quality\&.
.PP
In \fItoktx\fP you can prevent conversion of the normal map to two components by specifying '\fB--input_swizzle\fP rgb1'\&. 
.IP "\fB--normalize \fP" 1c
Normalize input normals to have a unit length\&. Only valid for linear textures with 2 or more components\&. For 2-component inputs 2D unit normals are calculated\&. Do not use these 2D unit normals to generate X+Y normals for --normal_mode\&. For 4-component inputs a 3D unit normal is calculated\&. 1\&.0 is used for the value of the 4th component\&. 
.IP "\fB--no_sse \fP" 1c
Forbid use of the SSE instruction set\&. Ignored if CPU does not support SSE\&. Only the Basis Universal compressor uses SSE\&. 
.IP "\fB--bcmp \fP" 1c
Deprecated\&. Use '\fB--encode\fP etc1s' instead\&. 
.IP "\fB--uastc [<level>] \fP" 1c
Deprecated\&. Use '\fB--encode\fP uastc' instead\&. 
.IP "\fB--zcmp [<compressionLevel>] \fP" 1c
Supercompress the data with Zstandard\&. Implies \fB--t2\fP\&. Can be used with data in any format except ETC1S / BasisLZ\&. Most effective with RDO-conditioned UASTC or uncompressed formats\&. The optional compressionLevel range is 1 - 22 and the default is 3\&. Lower values=faster but give less compression\&. Values above 20 should be used with caution as they require more memory\&. 
.IP "\fB--threads <count> \fP" 1c
Explicitly set the number of threads to use during compression\&. By default, ETC1S / BasisLZ and ASTC compression will use the number of threads reported by thread::hardware_concurrency or 1 if value returned is 0\&. 
.IP "\fB--verbose \fP" 1c
Print encoder/compressor activity status to stdout\&. Currently only the astc, etc1s and uastc encoders emit status\&. 
.PP
.IP "\fB-h, --help \fP" 1c
Print this usage message and exit\&. 
.IP "\fB-v, --version \fP" 1c
Print the version number of this program and exit\&. 
.PP
 In case of ambiguity, such as when the last option is one with an optional parameter, separate options from file names with ' -- '\&.
.PP
Any specified ASTC, ETC1S / BasisLZ, UASTC and supercompression options are recorded in the metadata item \fCKTXwriterScParams\fP in the output file\&.
